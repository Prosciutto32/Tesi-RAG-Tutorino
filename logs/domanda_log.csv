It establishes a connection with the server before data transfer begins, using a three-way handshake involving sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, and the SYN flag.  One of the key features of TCP is its ability to provide reliable data transfer through various mechanisms such as sequence numbers, timeouts/retransmissions, and the sliding windows algorithm. This ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and prevents data loss.  TCP is stream-oriented, meaning an application can write data in very small or very large amounts and the TCP layer will take care of packetization. Additionally, TCP transmits a stream of bytes, not messages or records.  The connection-oriented nature of TCP warrants further explanation.  Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of TCP?;12.98;  Sources: - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:53, chunck:5 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:53, chunck:5 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:57, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:57, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:125, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:125, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:0

This means that there's no guarantee that packets will be delivered or in order.  The key characteristics of UDP include:  * No connection establishment phase, which can add RTT delay * Simple: no connection state at sender and receiver * Small header size * No congestion control * UDP can ""blast away"" as fast as desired! * Can function in the face of congestion  These features make UDP suitable for applications that require fast and efficient transmission, but may not need reliable or guaranteed delivery.";10.95;  Sources: - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:13, chunck:3 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:13, chunck:3 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:15, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:15, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:1, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:1, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:15, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:15, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:3, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Kurose Capitolo 3.3.pdf:3, chunck:0

Whether you need help with a specific question or just want to have a conversation about a particular topic, Tutor is here to help.;Sure! Let's focus on the key differences between the TCP and UDP transport protocols:  **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: - **Connection-Oriented**: Connections are established before data is sent. This ensures that all packets in a session arrive in order. - **Reliable Delivery**: TCP uses sequence numbers to ensure that packets are delivered in the correct order, even if retransmissions occur due to network issues. - **Flow Control and Congestion Control**: These mechanisms help manage network congestion by limiting data transmission rates based on available bandwidth. - **Sliding Window Protocol**: This protocol manages multiple in-flight segments, allowing for efficient packet delivery. In a sliding window system, the receiver sends an acknowledgment (ACK) only if all expected packets have been received, otherwise, it waits until new packets can be sent.  **Examples of TCP Usage**: 1. Web Browsing: When you browse web pages over HTTP, the underlying transport layer is TCP. 2. Remote Desktop: Applications like Remote Desktop Protocol use TCP for reliable data transmission between a client and server. 3. Email Sending/Receiving: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), used to send emails across networks, relies on TCP for establishing connections.  **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: - **Connectionless**: Data packets are sent without the need to establish or maintain a connection before sending data. This makes it faster and more lightweight than TCP. - **No Flow Control and Reliability Guarantees**: UDP does not offer flow control, congestion control, or reliability checks. It is suitable for applications where high speed is critical but may tolerate packet loss in certain scenarios. - **Application-Layer Security**: As no transport layer provides security guarantees (e.g., encryption), application-layer protocols like SSL/TLS must be used if there's a need for data privacy and integrity.  **Examples of UDP Usage**: 1. Real-time Streaming: Applications that require low latency, such as video streaming services. 2. Broadcasting and Multicasting: Systems like IPTV and online gaming use broadcast channels to send streams to multiple devices simultaneously without the need for individual connections per device. 3. DNS Resolution: The User Datagram Protocol is used by Domain Name System (DNS) servers for quick resolution of domain names into IP addresses.  These differences are significant, particularly in environments where high-speed data transfer is critical versus scenarios where reliable delivery and flow control are necessary.;37.7;  Sources: - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:47, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:47, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:22, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:22, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:32, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:57, chunck:4 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:57, chunck:4

These differences suggest that TCP is more reliable but also slower, while UDP is faster but less reliable.;29.45;  Sources: - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:0, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:0, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:47, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:47, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:32, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:32, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:126, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:126, chunck:0

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of messages by acknowledging receipt from the receiver before sending the next message. It also provides mechanisms to detect errors and resends lost packets. In contrast, UDP is a simple, unreliable transport protocol where data packets are sent without establishing a connection first. UDP does not guarantee order or delivery, it only promises that packets will be sent in the order they were received but might lose some packets or deliver them out of sequence. TCP ensures reliability and correctness at the cost of increased overhead, whereas UDP is faster and more efficient for latency-sensitive applications where data loss can be tolerated.;14.05;  Sources: - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:0, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/Bonaventure Transport Layer Cap. 4.pdf:0, chunck:2 - ID: page:data/Trasporto_Mixed/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0 - ID: page:data/Transport_Mixed_Mxbai/ComputerNetworks Doral TCP&UDP copy.pdf:181, chunck:0
